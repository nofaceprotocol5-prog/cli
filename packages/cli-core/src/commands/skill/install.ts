/**
 * `clerk skill install` — installs the bundled `clerk` skill for local
 * agents.
 *
 * The `clerk` skill is embedded in the CLI binary via text imports at
 * compile time. At install time we stage it to a temp dir and invoke
 * `skills add <tmpdir> --copy`, so the installed files are full copies
 * (not symlinks into the temp dir, which would break when cleaned up).
 *
 * The external `skills` CLI handles agent auto-detection and scope
 * selection: in interactive mode we hand off entirely (no `--agent` / `-y`),
 * so the user gets the native picker. In non-interactive mode we pass
 * `-y -g` so it runs unattended with global scope and auto-detected agents.
 *
 * The `init` command also imports `installClerkSkillCore` and
 * `resolveSkillsRunner` from here so a single runner detection is shared
 * with the upstream framework-pattern skills install.
